## Installation

To install the prerequisite packages, clone the directory using:
```
git clone https://github.com/alee156/clviz.git
cd clviz
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Afterwards install opencv. This is easily accomplishable if you have brew or conda by either using:
 ```
 brew install opencv
 ```
 ```
 conda install opencv
 ```
 If not, install opencv by following their build instruction here: http://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/doc/py_tutorials/py_setup/py_table_of_contents_setup/py_table_of_contents_setup.html#py-table-of-content-setup

After installing the prerequisites there's two options for using clviz. You can use clviz as a standalone package and
perform basic analysis on your own files, or you can install ndreg and ndio and use clviz as a powerful integrating tool
for graph-based analysis.
